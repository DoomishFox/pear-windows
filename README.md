# pear 🍐

Pear is a local sharing application designed to be simple and painless. Initial goals are to be able to share URLs and small files across local devices with automatic discovery.

> *Note:* Pear is *NOT* secure. Maybe it will be someday, but for now don't use it for sensitive information.

This repository is a .NET Windows application that implements the pear sharing protocol. The protocol itself is a work in progress and I'm still writing the spec so this repo and [this one](https://github.com/DoomishFox/peard) are being built to test and develop the protocol.
